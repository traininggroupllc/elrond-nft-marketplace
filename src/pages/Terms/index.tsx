            <h1 className='section__body--title fw-bold'>
              1) What is Foundation?
            </h1>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              Foundation provides a platform for Users, including artists
              (“Creators”) and collectors (“Collectors”), to sell, purchase,
              list for auction, make offers on, and bid on (each a
              “Transaction”) Digital Artwork (as defined below).
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong> a) Smart-Contract Enabled.</strong> “Digital Artwork” on
              the Platform refers to a non-fungible Ethereum-based token that
              uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain (“Smart
              Contracts”). The Ethereum blockchain provides an immutable ledger
              of all transactions that occur on the blockchain. This means that
              all Digital Artwork is outside of the control of any one party,
              including Foundation, and is subject to many risks and
              uncertainties. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, the
              Ethereum network, the smart contracts on which Collections (as
              defined below) are based (“Collection Smart Contracts”), your
              browser, or any other third party site, product, or service that
              you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to
              use the various features of the Platform. We will not be liable
              for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we
              be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your
              transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.
              You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made
              publicly visible whenever you engage in a Transaction on the
              Platform.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong> b) Noncustodial.</strong> While Foundation offers a
              marketplace for Digital Artwork, it does not buy, sell, or ever
              take custody or possession of any Digital Artwork. The Platform
              facilitates User collection of Digital Artwork, but neither
              Foundation nor the Platform are custodians of any Digital Artwork.
              The User understands and acknowledges that the Smart Contracts do
              not give Foundation custody, possession, or control of any Digital
              Artwork or cryptocurrency at any time for the purpose of
              facilitating Transactions on the Platform. You affirm that you are
              aware and acknowledge that Foundation is a non-custodial service
              provider and has designed the Platform to be directly accessible
              by the Users without any involvement or actions taken by
              Foundation or any third-party. Foundation facilitates Transactions
              between the Users on the Platform but is not a party to any
              agreement between any sellers, buyers, Creators, Collectors, and
              other Users. As a marketplace, Foundation cannot make any
              representation or guarantee that Creators or Users will achieve
              any particular outcome as the result of listing their Digital
              Artwork or engaging in any other Transaction on the Platform.

              <strong> a) Your Registration Obligations:</strong> Anyone can
              browse the Platform without registering for an account. You may be
              required to register with Foundation in order to access and use
              certain features on the Platform, such as participating as a
              Creator or Collector. If you choose to register for the Platform,
              you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current, and
              complete information about yourself as prompted by our
              registration form. Registration data and certain other information
              about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. You must be at least
              13 years old to register for an account as a Creator, and at least
              18 years old to place a bid on any Digital Artwork. If you are
              between 13 and 18 years old, you must have the expressed
              permission of a parent or legal guardian who can accept these
              Terms on your behalf. You are responsible for anything that occurs
              when anyone is signed in to your account, as well as the security
              of the account.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong>b) Member Account, Password, and Security:</strong> You
              are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
              account and password, if any, and are fully responsible for any
              and all activities that occur under your password or account. You
              agree to (a) immediately notify Foundation of any unauthorized use
              of your password or account or any other breach of security, and
              (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each
              session when accessing the Platform. Foundation will not be liable
              for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with
              this Section.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong> c) Connecting your Wallet:</strong> In order to
              participate as a Creator or Collector on the Platform, you must
              connect your account to your digital wallet supported on MetaMask,
              WalletConnect or other wallet extensions or gateways as allowed on
              the Platform. Such digital wallets allow you to purchase, store,
              and engage in transactions using the native Ethereum
              cryptocurrency, ETH. All Transactions on the Platform are in the
              native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong> d) Modifications to the Platform:</strong> Foundation
              reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
              permanently, the Platform (or any part thereof) with or without
              notice. You agree that Foundation will not be liable to you or to
              any third party for any modification, suspension, or
              discontinuance of the Platform.

              and agrees that by launching, listing, or selling any Digital
              Artwork (including Non-Foundation Artwork) on the Platform, User

              display or perform the Art Content or Non-Foundation Content

            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong>c) Collector Rights</strong> <br />
              <strong>i)</strong> The Collector receives a cryptographic token
              representing the Creator’s Art Content as a piece of property, but
              does not own the Art Content itself or any intellectual property
              rights therein. The Collector may display and share the Art
              Content, but the Collector does not have any legal ownership,
              right, or title to any copyrights, trademarks, or other
              intellectual property rights to the Art Content, except the
              limited license to the Art Content granted by these Terms.
            </p>

              <strong> ii)</strong> Upon legally collecting and obtaining
              ownership of any Digital Artwork launched on the Platform, the
              Collector receives from the seller of such Digital Artwork a
              limited, worldwide, non-assignable and non-transferable (except as
              expressly set forth below), non-sublicensable, royalty-free
              license to display the Art Content underlying such Digital Artwork
              solely for the Collector’s non-commercial purposes, including the
              right to display such Art Content privately or publicly: (i) for
              the purpose of promoting or sharing the Collector’s purchase of,
              ownership of, or interest in such Digital Artwork, (ii) for the
              purpose of sharing, promoting, discussing, or commenting on such
              Art Content; (iii) on third party marketplaces, exchanges,
              platforms, or applications in association with an offer to sell,
              or trade, the Digital Artwork; and (iv) within decentralized
              virtual environments, virtual worlds, virtual galleries, virtual
              museums, or other navigable and perceivable virtual environments
              (the “Collector License”). Upon any sale or transfer of the
              Digital Artwork to another collector, (a) the foregoing license
              will automatically transfer to such other collector, and such
              other collector will be deemed the “Collector” (for purposes of
              such Digital Artwork and the Collector License to the underlying
              Art Content) and will be subject to these Terms and (b) the seller
              or transferor of such Digital Artwork will cease to have any
              further rights to such Art Content.{' '}
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong> iii)</strong> While the Collector has the right to sell,
              trade, transfer, or use their Digital Artwork, the Collector may
              not make commercial use of the Digital Artwork or its underlying
              Art Content.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong> iv)</strong> If a Collector sells, trades or transfers
              its Digital Artwork to a subsequent Collector, regardless of
              whether on or off the Platform, such Collector represents and
              warrants that it will (i) notify the subsequent Collector of these
              Terms and (ii) require the subsequent Collector to comply with
              these Terms.{' '}
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong>v)</strong> The Collector agrees that it will not, and
              will not permit any third party to, do or attempt to do any of the
              foregoing without the Creator’s express prior written consent in
              each case: (i) modify, distort, mutilate, or perform any other
              modification to the Art Content which would be prejudicial to the
              Creator’s honor or reputation; (ii) use the Digital Artwork or
              underlying Art Content to advertise, market, or sell any third
              party product or service; (iii) use the Digital Artwork or
              underlying Art Content in connection with images, videos, or other
              forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty,
              or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate
              speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iv)
              incorporate the Digital Artwork or underlying Art Content in
              movies, videos, video games, or any other forms of media for a
              commercial purpose, except to the limited extent that such use is
              expressly permitted by these Terms or solely for Collector’s
              personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial
              gain, or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes,
              contains, or consists of the Digital Artwork or underlying Art
              Content; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise
              acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the
              Digital Artwork or underlying Art Content; (vii) attempt to mint,
              tokenize, or create an additional cryptographic token representing
              the same Digital Artwork or underlying Art Content, whether on or
              off of the Platform; (viii) falsify, misrepresent, or conceal the
              authorship of the Digital Artwork or underlying Art Content; or
              (ix) otherwise utilize any Art Content or, except as expressly
              permitted under these Terms, the Digital Artwork for the
              Collector’s or any third party’s commercial benefit. Collector
              agrees that it receives no rights to any Collection Content and
              will not use, copy, distribute or otherwise exploit the Collection
              Content in any manner.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              <strong>vi)</strong> Collector irrevocably releases, acquits, and
              forever discharges Foundation and its Affiliates and it and their
              officers and successors of any liability for direct or indirect
              copyright or trademark infringement for Foundation’s use of any
              Digital Artwork or underlying Art Content, or any Collection
              Content, in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>
            <p className='fs-5'>

              minted on or by a third party platform or service (“Non-Foundation
              Artwork”) and the intellectual property rights of the content
              underlying such Non-Foundation Artwork (“Non-Foundation Content”)
              may be subject to separate license or other terms granted in
              connection with the initial sale of such Non-Foundation Artwork
              (“Non-Foundation Artwork Terms”), in which case those
              Non-Foundation Artwork Terms will govern in connection with such
              content and materials, provided that in the event of any conflict
              between the Non-Foundation Artwork Terms and these Terms that are
              not specific to a Collector’s rights to use or otherwise exploit
              the Non-Foundation Content, these Terms shall govern and control
              as between you and Foundation. Subject to the foregoing, if you
              purchase any Non-Foundation Artwork, you agree to comply with the
              Non-Foundation Artwork Terms.

            </h1>
            <p className='fs-5'>
              These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and
              Foundation and govern your use of the Platform, superseding any
              prior agreements between you and Foundation with respect to the
              Platform. You also may be subject to additional terms and
              conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party
              services, third party content or third party software. These Terms
              will be governed by the laws of the State of California without
              regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any
              disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above,
              you and Foundation agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
              jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San
              Francisco County, California. The failure of Foundation to
              exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
              constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
              of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
              invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
              endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in
              the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in
              full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or
              law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of
              or related to use of the Platform or these Terms must be filed
              within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
              be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any
              notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or
              administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
              agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
              other business documents and records originally generated and
              maintained in printed form. You may not assign the Terms without
              the prior written consent of Foundation, but Foundation may assign
              or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.
              The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and
              have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made

                by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as
                the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes
                or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and
                Foundation, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms
                (including any alleged breach thereof), the Platforms, any
                advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions
                between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and
                binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
                terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert
                individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
                Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from
                bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
                agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
                against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into
                these Terms, you and Foundation are each waiving the right to a
                trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights
                will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
                The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

                <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong> Foundation
                is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
                efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly
                and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support
                at support@foundation.app. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a
                party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
                other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
                (“Notice”). The Notice to Foundation should be sent to 11420
                Santa Monica Blvd, PO Box 252111, Los Angeles, CA 90025 (“Notice
                Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of
                the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief
                sought. If Foundation and you do not resolve the claim within
                sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or
                Foundation may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
                Foundation or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
                after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you
                or Foundation is entitled.
              </li>
              <li className='fs-5'>
                <strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong> Arbitration will be
                conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the
                American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures,
                including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,
                the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For
                information on the AAA, please visit its website,
                http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for
                consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration
                page, http://www.adr.org/ as may be updated from time to time.
                If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules
                and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms
                of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
                determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of
                these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator
                to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the
                scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
                Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler
                and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings,
                the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an
                individual basis that a court can award to an individual under
                these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are
                enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for
                very limited reasons. Unless Foundation and you agree otherwise,
                any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably
                convenient location for both parties with due consideration of
                their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If
                the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination
                shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
                Foundation agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration
                will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to
                the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person
                hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
                $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
                Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
                conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
                decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
                conclusions on which the award is based.
              </li>
              <li className='fs-5'>
                <strong>Costs of Arbitration </strong> Payment of all filing,
                administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
                “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless
                otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value
                of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request,
                Foundation will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief
                sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to
                the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your
                portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
                determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay
                your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Foundation will pay your
                portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the
                arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
                compared to the costs of litigation, Foundation will pay as much
                of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to
                prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment
                of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

                <strong> Severability</strong> If a court or the arbitrator
                decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and
                Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is
                invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term
                or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
                enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
                of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
                Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a
                court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of
                subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and
                Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are
                invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration
                Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are
                deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to
                claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these
                Terms will continue to apply.
